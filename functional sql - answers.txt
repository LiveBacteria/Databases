Commands for adding is 'ADD', updating is 'UPDATE' and, deleting is 'DELETE'

ADDING is basically adding an entirely new value;

Updating is basically taking a value and updating it.

Deleting is as it sounds, it deletes data.

Alter is also as it sounds, but can be used to ADD columns and such.

DROP is used for basically deleting an entire table, like DELETE but more severe.

Real world data types that could be used in data tables would be dates, the time, and even the average speed of a car.
